## Short Bio
I am a computer scientist specializing in the intersection of artificial intelligence and education (AIEd), with a robust foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of the field. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/), an Engineer degree in Computer Science from the [University of Science and Technology USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/), and a Magister degree in Computer Science from the [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/).

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/), within the [TWEAK](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/tweak) team. I am part of the MOBILES project, which leverages advanced analytics to understand and support the spatial practices of international students in France. My role involves developing AI-driven solutions to enhance educational experiences and foster better integration for students.

Previously, I worked as a research engineer at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) in Brest, France, where I developed innovative analytical tools and models for digital learning practices. Earlier, I was a full-time researcher at the [Algerian Research Center on Scientific and Technical Information CERIST](https://www.cerist.dz/), focusing on data organization, learning technologies, educational data analysis, and the application of artificial intelligence to digital education. My work aims to bridge the gap between AI and education, making learning more accessible and effective through technology.
