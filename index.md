## Short Bio
I am a computer scientist with a robust foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of the field. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/), an Engineer degree in Computer Science from the [University of Science and Technology USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/), and a Magister degree in Computer Science from the [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/).

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/), within the [TWEAK](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/tweak) team. I am part of the MOBILES project, which aims to understand and support the spatial practices of international students in France through advanced analytics.

Previously, I worked as a research engineer at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) in Brest, France, where I developed innovative analytical tools and models for digital learning practices. Earlier, I was a full-time researcher at the [Algerian Research Center on Scientific and Technical Information CERIST](https://www.cerist.dz/), focusing on data organization, learning technologies, educational data analysis, and the application of artificial intelligence to digital education.

## Research Topics

My current research primarily focuses on the intersection of Learning Analytics, Educational Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence in Education. Key areas of interest include:

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** Exploring ways to enhance the interaction between humans and computers in educational settings.
- **Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL):** Leveraging technology to create more effective and engaging learning environments.
- **Design and Co-Design of Analytics Tools:** Developing and refining tools for analyzing educational data, often with the involvement of end-users.
- **Knowledge Engineering:** Investigating methods to capture, represent, and apply knowledge in educational contexts.
- **Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED):** Harnessing AI techniques to personalize and optimize the learning experience.
- **Digital & Multimedia Document Reengineering:** Transforming digital content and multimedia resources to better support education.
- **Hypermedia and Hypervideo Systems:** Studying the use of hypermedia and hypervideo technologies in educational content and delivery.

These areas constitute the core of my research focus, driving my efforts to advance educational practices and technology.
