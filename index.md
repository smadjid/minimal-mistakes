## Short Bio
I hold a PhD in Computer Sciences from the  [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/) (Bejaia, Algeria), as well as an Engineer degree in Computer Sciences from the [University of Science and Technology USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/) (Algiers, Algeria) and a Magister degree in Computer Sciences from the [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/). 

Currently, I serve as a research engineer at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) (Brest, France), where I am part of the  [MOTEL](https://labsticc.fr/fr/equipes/motel) team. My research focus is on developing advanced analytical tools to enhance digital learning practices and improve the overall learning experience. Before my current role, I served as a full-time permanent researcher (Ma√Ætre de Recherche B) at  the [Algerian Research Center on Scientific and Technical Information CERIST](https://www.cerist.dz/).
