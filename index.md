## Short Bio
I hold a PhD in Computer Sciences from the  [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/) (Bejaia, Algeria), as well as an Engineer degree in Computer Sciences from the [University of Science and Technology USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/) (Algiers, Algeria) and a Magister degree in Computer Sciences from the [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/). 

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/), specifically within the [TWEAK](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/tweak) team. Prior to this, I held the position of research engineer at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) in Brest, France, where I was an integral part of the [MOTEL](https://labsticc.fr/fr/equipes/motel) research team. My research is centered around the development of advanced analytical tools aimed at enhancing digital learning practices and improving the overall learning experience. Before my tenure at IMT Atlantique, I served as a full-time permanent researcher (Ma√Ætre de Recherche B) at the [Algerian Research Center on Scientific and Technical Information CERIST](https://www.cerist.dz/).

## Research topics 
My current research primarily focuses on the intersection of Learning Analytics, Educational Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence in Education. Key areas of interest include:

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** Exploring ways to enhance the interaction between humans and computers in educational settings.

- **Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL):** Leveraging technology to create more effective and engaging learning environments.

- **Design and Co-Design of Analytics Tools:** Developing and refining tools for analyzing educational data, often with the involvement of end-users.

- **Knowledge Engineering:** Investigating methods to capture, represent, and apply knowledge in educational contexts.

- **Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED):** Harnessing AI techniques to personalize and optimize the learning experience.

- **Digital & Multimedia Document Reengineering:** Transforming digital content and multimedia resources to better support education.

- **Hypermedia and Hypervideo Systems:** Studying the use of hypermedia and hypervideo technologies in educational content and delivery.

These areas constitute the core of my research focus, driving my efforts to advance educational practices and technology.
